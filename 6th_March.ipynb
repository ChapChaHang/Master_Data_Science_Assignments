Gender is a nominal variable, as it has no order or ranking, while academic performance is an ordinal variable, as grades have a natural order or ranking (e.g. A, B, C).To analyze this relationship,we can use chi-square test.Alternatively, if we want to compare the mean grades of male and female students, we can use a t-test, which assumes interval or ratio data. In this case, we need to convert the ordinal grade data into interval or ratio data, such as using a point system where A=4, B=3, C=2, and so on.By understanding the level of measurement and choosing the appropriate statistical test, we can accurately determine if there is a significant relationship between gender and academic performance among college students.
